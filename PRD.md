# Laprdus TTS Product Requirements Document (PRD) #

## Overview

This is Laprdus, a cross-platform concatinative text-to-speech engine that supports languages such as Croatian and Serbian. It currently works on Microsoft Windows 7 through Windows 11 using either Microsoft SAPI 5 standard, or as standalone with free and open-source screen reader NVDA. It also works on Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora and Arch via Speech Dispatcher or as a standalone utility to output text.
Laprdus uses phoneme data files for producing speech. It also has its own internal dictionary for spelling and pronounciation. One of its special features is reading numbers as digits or full numbers, and controlling pauses for various punctuation symbols.
Before implementing given tasks, first examine the entire codebase and code structure for in-depth understanding of the codebase, code structure, build system and building methods, as well as additional tools for building / packing voice binaries. Core Laprdus code is located inside /src directory. Android source code is located inside /android directory. NVDA add-on code is located inside /nvda-addon directory. Platform installers are located inside /installers directory.
